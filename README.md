### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexander, and I'm a Unit Lead DWH at [Kuper (ex Sbermarket)](https://github.com/Kuper-Tech).

I'm currently working on building a data warehouse with focus on data governance processes.

What else?
- Made from scratch a heroku-like platform for launching microservices in Kuper (ex Sbermarket)](https://github.com/Kuper-Tech). Lunch time for new service is less then 5 minutes. More product value in short time! [Here is the speach](https://youtu.be/_wnXGe8dgVw?si=nbViyYaRagXRTyRC) about platform.
- Made [Lefthook](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook) githooks automation tool written in Golang. Raised it to [>1,5k](https://twitter.com/evilmartians_ru/status/1253267933226242050) stars on Github. My blog post about it [here](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/lefthook-knock-your-teams-code-back-into-shape).
- Significant contribution to [tines.io](https://tines.io/). Increase system performance by up to 100 times, here the [article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/product-design-that-sells-the-smart-ux-for-tines).
- Helped to grow GMV for one of Ebay projects - [Ebaymag](https://ebaymag.com/). [That's how it went](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/finding-growth-how-to-hack-ebaymag-with-growth-hacking).
- Won [Stellar Community Fund](https://medium.com/stellar-community/stellar-community-fund-2-the-results-69b3f6a6040e) with my implementation of blockchain node written in Rust - [Astrocore](https://github.com/astroband/astrocore). Some brief introduction [here](https://galactictalk.org/d/2102-astrocore-rusted-stellar-core).
- Got _The Arctic Code Vault_ achivement as an opensource enthusiast. For contribution in Rust ecosystem, Ruby gems and projects.
- Public speaker [Agile vs Waterfall](https://youtu.be/D5x96DymfGc?si=IWZIf4VS_cChiiUb)

...and much more.
