### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexander, and I'm a teamlead at SberMarket.

I'm currently working on building a PaaS platform for launching microservices in production with shortes TTM as possible.

What else?
- Made [Lefthook](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook) githooks automation tool written in Golang. Raised it to [>1,5k](https://twitter.com/evilmartians_ru/status/1253267933226242050) stars on Github. My blog post about it [here](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/lefthook-knock-your-teams-code-back-into-shape).
- Significant contribution to [tines.io](https://tines.io/). Increase system performance by up to 100 times, here the [article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/product-design-that-sells-the-smart-ux-for-tines).
- Helped to grow GMV for one of Ebay projects - [Ebaymag](https://ebaymag.com/). [That's how it went](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/finding-growth-how-to-hack-ebaymag-with-growth-hacking).
- Won [Stellar Community Fund](https://medium.com/stellar-community/stellar-community-fund-2-the-results-69b3f6a6040e) with my implementation of blockchain node written in Rust - [Astrocore](https://github.com/astroband/astrocore). Some brief introduction [here](https://galactictalk.org/d/2102-astrocore-rusted-stellar-core).
- Got _The Arctic Code Vault_ achivement as an opensource enthusiast. For contribution in Rust ecosystem, Ruby gems and projects.

...and much more.
